The data/conjugation-it.xml and data/verbs-it.xml files were
created by Christophe Durville <http://polyglotte.tuxfamily.org>.
They have a double copyright notice and are distributed under the
same license as the rest of Verbiste.

Note that src/gtk/verbiste.cls and src/gtk/verbiste.cfg were written
by J.J. Green, who put them in the public domain.

INSTALLATION: see INSTALL.  Noteworthy configuration options:

    --with-gnome-app            compiles the GNOME application
    --with-mate-applet          compiles the MATE Panel applet
    --with-gtk-app              compiles the GTK+ application

The GTK+ app is identical to the GNOME app, but it avoids any
dependency on the GNOME libraries.  However, the GTK+ version's Save
dialog does not remember the last directory used (the GNOME version
uses the gnome-config API for this).  One can compile both the GNOME
and GTK+ applications, which are named respectively "verbiste" and
"verbiste-gtk".

Main requirements: iconv, libxml2, MATE Panel (for applet), Perl's
XML::Parser module (for compilation).

Manual pages installed by this package:

    verbiste(1)                 about this library and the GNOME interfaces
    french-conjugator(3)        command to conjugate French verbs
    french-deconjugator(3)      command to analyze conjugated French verbs

The 'examples' directory of the source archive contains Perl and Java
programs that illustrate how to call the french-deconjugator command
as an external process through two pipes.


OPENING VERBISTE WITH A VERB

You can pass a verb as an argument to the `verbiste' or `verbiste-gtk'
graphical programs to make them display an initial conjugation.


ADDING YOUR OWN VERBS

Since version 0.1.34, the user can add verbs in a way that avoids
editing the files distributed with Verbiste.

Create a directory called ".verbiste" (without the quotes, but with
the leading period) in your home directory. In that .verbiste directory,
create a file called verbs-fr.xml and put this in it for example:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<verbs-fr>

<v><i>smurfer</i>  <t>aim:er</t></v>

</verbs-fr>

The element in the <t> tag must be the name of a conjugation model
defined in the conjugation-fr.xml file distributed with Verbiste.
Add a <v> line for each new verb. You must restart Verbiste for
changes to this file to become usable.

Your file must be encoded in UTF-8, not in Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).
