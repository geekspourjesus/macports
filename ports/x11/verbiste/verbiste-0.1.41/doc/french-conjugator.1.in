.SH NAME
french-conjugator - conjugate French verbs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B echo aimer | french-conjugator > result.txt
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfrench-conjugator\fR
reads the infinitive form of French verbs from
the command line or from standard input
and writes (to standard output) the complete conjugation of those
verbs, if they are known.
.PP
The standard input is not read if verbs are passed as command-line
arguments.
.PP
Each mode and tense is introduced by a line that starts with a hyphen
and a space, and ends with a colon.
The mode and tense in that line are always in English, regardless
of the user's current locale.
(This is meant to facilitate automatic parsing of the output.
For a French user interface, see the GNOME application and applet.)
The conjugation is ended with a line that only contains a hyphen.
If the given verb is unknown or not in the infinitive form,
only this line is written.
.PP
The command flushes its output buffer after finishing each answer.
This allows the command to be easily called from another program
through two pipes.
.PP
The command starts by loading its database from XML files
(stored typically in /usr/share/verbiste).
This takes some time, so it is a good idea to have the command
answer many requests instead of running it for each request.
.PP
The verbiste library's source archive contains Perl and Java
example programs that illustrate this technique.
.PP
There must not be any leading or trailing white spaces on the lines read
by the command.
.PP
In the \fBpast participle\fR tense, four lines are written: they correspond
in order
to the masculine singular, masculine plural, feminine singular and
feminine plural.
