.SH NAME
french-deconjugator - analyze conjugated French verbs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B echo aim\('e | french-deconjugator > result.txt
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfrench-deconjugator\fR
reads conjugated French verbs from
the command line or from standard input
and writes (to standard output)
the verb's \fBinfinitive\fR form,
the \fBmode\fR (infinitive, indicative, conditional, subjunctive,
imperative or participle),
the \fBtense\fR (present, past, imperfect, future),
the \fBperson\fR (1, 2 or 3,
while 0 is used for the present participle tense,
and 4 and 5 are used in the past participle tense),
and
the \fBnumber\fR (singular or plural).
These fields are separated by a comma and a space.
.PP
The standard input is not read if verbs are passed as command-line
arguments.
.PP
By convention, persons 4 and 5 are used in the
\fBpast participle\fR
tense to indicate the gender:
4 means masculine (e.g., "aim\('e" or "aim\('es")
and 5 means feminine (e.g., "aim\('ee" or "aim\('ees").
.PP
A single conjugated form can correspond to more than one mode,
tense and person.
In this case, each alternative is written on its own line.
.PP
In all cases, the end of the answer is marked by an empty line.
If the word is unknown, only this empty line is written.
The names for the mode, tense and number are always in English.
(This is meant to facilitate automatic parsing of the output.
For a French user interface, see the GNOME application and applet.)
.PP
The command flushes its output buffer after finishing each answer.
This allows the command to be easily called from another program
through two pipes.
.PP
The command starts by loading its database from XML files
(stored typically in /usr/share/verbiste).
This takes some time, so it is a good idea to have the command
answer many requests instead of running it for each request.
.PP
The verbiste library's source archive contains Perl and Java
example programs that illustrate this technique.
.PP
This commands expects to read Latin-1 characters and writes Latin-1 characters.
There must not be any leading or trailing white spaces on the lines read
by the command.
