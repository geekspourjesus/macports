.SH NAME
verbiste \- french conjugation system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g++ prog.cpp `pkg\-config \-\-cflags \-\-libs libxml\-2.0` \-lverbiste-0.1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBVerbiste\fR
is a library that can conjugate French verbs given in the infinitive form
and analyze conjugated French verbs.
It is also a GNOME application and a GTK+ application.
.PP
There are two commands, named
\fBfrench-conjugator(1)\fR
and
\fBfrench-deconjugator(1)\fR,
which make the library's functionality available
from the command line and from scripts.
.PP
The GNOME application should be available under the GNOME Office menu.
It can also be run from the command line
by typing
\fBverbiste\fR.
A verb can be passed as an argument to have the window display its
conjugation automatically.
.PP
If the GTK+ application is installed, it can be run by typing \fBverbiste-gtk\fR.
It also accepts a verb as an argument.
.SH EXAMPLES
The library's source archive comes with Perl and Java example programs
that call the
\fBfrench-conjugator(1)\fR
and
\fBfrench-deconjugator(1)\fR
commands.
There are also example programs that use the C application programming
interface.
.PP
The library and the commands use verb and conjugation knowledge bases
that are represented as XML files that are installed with the library
(typically in /usr/share/verbiste-0.1).

.SH BUGS
The FrenchVerbDictionary object is not completely destroyed when its
destructor is called, in order to avoid the excessively long clean up time
of its internal trie.
Only one instance of this class should be created and it should be destroyed
when the program quits.
