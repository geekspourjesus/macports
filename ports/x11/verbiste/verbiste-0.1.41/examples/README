    Conjugator program that demonstrates the C API.
    This programs works in Latin-1.

    Deconjugator program that demonstrates the C API.
    This programs works in Latin-1.

FrenchDeconjugatorTester.java

    Java program that calls the french-deconjugator command through
    two pipes with Runtime.getRuntime().exec().

    To compile this program into a native executable using the
    GNU Java compiler:

        gcj --main=FrenchDeconjugatorTester FrenchDeconjugatorTester.java

    This will create an executable called a.out, which expects to find
    the french-deconjugator command in the current directory.  If this
    command is elsewhere, a.out will accept the complete file name of
    the french-deconjugator command as an executable:

        a.out ../src/commands/french-deconjugator

test-french-deconjugator.pl

    Perl program that calls the french-deconjugator command
    through two pipes with open2().  This program expects the
    french-deconjugator command to be in the PATH.

trans-tenses.pl

    Perl program that translates the mode and tense names written
    by french-conjugator from English to French (e.g., "infinitive
    present" becomes "infinitif pr√©sent").  The french-conjugator
    command writes these mode and tense names in English so
    that they can be used as fixed keywords by other programs.
    (The same principle holds for the french-deconjugator command.)
    This script writes in UTF-8.
