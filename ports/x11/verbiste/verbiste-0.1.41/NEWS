    manual pages are now under /usr/share/man instead of /usr/man.
    The .desktop file now uses the X-Red-Hat-Extra category instead
    of X-Red-Hat-Base.  Other changes have been made to (try to)

    should be needed anymore, hopefully.

    Stopped defining libdatadir in configure.ac, which created problems
    when make install would install in the 'NONE' subdirectory instead
    of the normal default, /usr/local.

    AC_DISABLE_STATIC in configure.ac avoids building the static

    The french-conjugator(1) now has options to request a specific
    mode and tense.

    Rows in the trie now implemented as vectors instead of hashes,
    since they only contain 1.4 elements on average.  There are about
    18800 rows in the trie at this time, so that made a difference:
    the french-deconjugator command now takes 9 megs of RAM on my
    system instead of 19 megs.  Also, the trie is deleted, since its
    destruction time is now much shorter.

    French manual page verbiste.3 now correctly installed in
    $(mandir)/fr/man3 instead of $(mandir)/fr/man1.

    Macro and environment variable PKGDATADIR renamed LIBDATADIR.

    XML data files in $prefix/share/verbiste-0.1 instead of
    $prefix/share/verbiste.
