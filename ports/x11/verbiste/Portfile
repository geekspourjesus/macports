long_description    \
    Verbiste is a French conjugation system.\
    It contains a C++ library, two programs that can be run from the command line \
    or from another program, and a GNOME application. \
    This application shows a text field in the GNOME Panel where the user can enter a conjugated verb and obtain its complete conjugation. \
    The knowledge base is represented in XML and contains over 7000 French verbs. \
    It also contains about 190 Italian verbs. \
    The dialog allows selecting the language in which the verb is to be searched.
